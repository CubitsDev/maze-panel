# maze-panel

Created for use by the MazeRP community/ SantosRP

Built for IPB4.2 and SantosRP Gamemode/MazeRP Gamemode

Decided to make Public as of today (18/12/2019), may not work on old leaked versions of Santos due to different Database structures, but feel free to use this as a guide almost on how to maybe build your own panel.

I won't provide any support, this is outdated as hell and made when I was a GCSE student. Use the New OAuth IPB logon template that I made if you want to build a modern panel. [Find it Here](https://github.com/TomTheDuck/IPB-OAuth2-NodeJS-Auth)
